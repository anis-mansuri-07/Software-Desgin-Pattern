# 🧠 Software Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains practical implementations of **Software Design Patterns** developed as part of my **Master of Computer Applications (MCA)** coursework.  
Each folder represents a specific design pattern implemented in **Java**, demonstrating real-world use cases, flexibility, and reusability of object-oriented design principles.

## 🎯 Overview

Software Design Patterns are proven solutions to common software development problems.  
They make code more **modular**, **scalable**, and **maintainable**.

This repository includes examples of **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** patterns, each implemented through clear, commented Java programs.

---

## 🏗️ Creational Design Patterns

Creational patterns focus on the **efficient and flexible creation of objects**.  
They abstract the instantiation process, making the system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.  
These patterns improve scalability and make code easier to maintain or extend when adding new object types.  
They also promote **loose coupling** between client code and concrete classes.  
**Examples:** Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype.

## 🧩 Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns deal with the **composition and organization of classes and objects** to form larger, more complex structures.  
They simplify relationships between entities and help ensure flexibility and reusability.  
By using these patterns, developers can easily modify system structure without affecting existing code behavior.  
They focus on how components interact and fit together, often improving code **readability and maintainability**.  
**Examples:** Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Composite, Proxy, Bridge.

## ⚙️ Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with **communication and interaction between objects**.  
They define how objects cooperate and distribute responsibilities dynamically to achieve a specific functionality.  
These patterns reduce tight coupling and make the flow of control more manageable.  
They help in making systems **more flexible, reusable, and easier to modify** as behaviors evolve.  
**Examples:** Strategy, State, Observer, Chain of Responsibility, Command, Template Method.

## 🚀 How to Run 

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/anis-mansuri-07/Software-Desgin-Pattern.git
   ```

2. Open any folder (e.g., `SingletonPattern`) in your IDE.
3. Run the `Main` or `Demo` class for that pattern.
4. Observe console output explaining pattern behavior.
